# Evolutionary-Algorithms
Evolutionary Algorithms Matlab Code
- Optimization Algorithm contains matlab file to show the comparison of different evolutionary algorithms in bench mark function with convergence curve. (Run the main.m). Read me file in the folder contain the algorithm names.
- Real-coded Genetic algorithm contains matlab files of genetic algorithm with different selection policy roullete wheel, tournament and random. (run the main.m)
- Software effort estimation with GP and GA contains matlab files to solve software estimation problem with genetic programming and then provide the function as fitness of genetic algorithm and estimate the parameters. (run softwareestimationgp.m in GP folder to get the equation and then provide it in fitness.m in GA folder and run main.m)  
- TSP GA contains matlab files to solve travel sales man problem with genetic algorithm.
- Neural Network contains neural newtwork problem with bak propagation as well as evolutionary algorithm toolbox like PSO, Greywolf optimizer and GA
